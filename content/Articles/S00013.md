Abstract: The primary paper proposed an anatomically detailed model of the human cerebral circulation that runs faster than real-time on a desktop computer and is designed for use in clinical settings when the speed of response is important. Based on a one-dimensional formulation of the flow of an incompressible fluid in distensible vessels, a lumped parameter model was developed for 218 arterial segments. The proposed model improved simulation speed by approximately 200-fold while preserved accuracy.  Bond graph formulation was used to ensure mass and energy conservation. The model predicted the pressure and flow signatures in the body.
